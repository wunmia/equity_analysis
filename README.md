# equity_analysis
(WIP) This project seeks to analysis stocks through both financial statements and alsoo equity performance

The program first scrapes income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statements, from these it calculates some performance metrics e.g. asset turnover, quick ratio, earning per share, investment as % of profits
The program then looks at the equity performance analysing returns, using technical indicators to recognise momentum and black scholes to understand how volatile the stock is
The code is still in development, the goal is to integrate these two pieces, and being able to compare metrics across stock in order to find potential mispricings
